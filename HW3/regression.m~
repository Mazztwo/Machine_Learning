% First, download the winequality-red.csv file, load it in Matlab 
% (e.g. using dlmread). 
Standardize the data, by computing 
% the mean and standard deviation for each feature dimension using the 
% train set only, then subtracting the mean and dividing by the stdev for 
% each feature and each sample. Append a 1 for each feature vector, which 
% will correspond to the bias that our model learns.

all_data = dlmread("winequality-red.csv", ";", 1, 0);
