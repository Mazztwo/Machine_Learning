% Inputs:
% the transition matrix A (from hmm_starter.m),
% the observation matrix B (from hmm_starter.m),
% N, the number of states,
% M, the number of words in the vocabulary, and
% sent, a vector of integers representing the sentence whose observation probability we want to compute.
% 
% Outputs:
% prob, the probability of observing the input sentence.



function [prob] = naive_solution(A,B,N,M,sent)
    % Using two input variables V and N, M = PERMN(V,N) returns all
    % permutations of N elements taken from the vector V, with repetitions.
    
    prob = 0;
        
    % The number of words in the sentence + the start state
    num_states = size(sent,2) + 1;
    
    
    sequences = permn(A, num_states);
