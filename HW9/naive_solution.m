% Inputs:
% the transition matrix A (from hmm_starter.m),
% the observation matrix B (from hmm_starter.m),
% N, the number of states,
% M, the number of words in the vocabulary, and
% a vector of integers sent representing the sentence whose observation probability we want to compute.
% 
% Outputs:
% prob, the probability of observing the input sentence.



function [prob] = naive_solution(A,B,N,M,sent)
    
    % Given a sentance = [X X X ... X]
    % X = state = word
    % We can easily find each word in B and get the probabilities if in
    % each state
