% Write a function function [B] = normalize_rows(A) which uses a single command 
% (one line and no loops) to make the sum in each row of the matrix 1. You may 
% need to use repmat, depending on your Matlab version. Note that the sum of the 
% entries in each row should be 1, in the matrix output by your function.


function [outputMatrix] = normalize_rows(inputMatrix)

    outputMatrix = repmat(inputMatrix(:,1)+0, size(inputMatrix,2));
    
end
